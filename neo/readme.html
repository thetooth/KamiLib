<h2>About</h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>OS: Windows Vista or higher, Linux 2.6 or higher</li>
  <li>Processor: Intel Pentium 4 northwood</li>
  <li>Memory: 256MB free(at least 1GB recommended)</li>
  <li>GPU: 128MB, OpenGL 3.3 compatible card, Intel HD3000 or higher integrated.</li>
  <li>Disk: 50MB</li>
</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><u><strong>Game runs extremely slowly</strong></u> Ensure your computer meets the system requirements and that nothing resource-intensive is running.  Try updating or reinstalling your graphic drivers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><u><strong>Fullscreen does not work</strong></u> Your monitor probably doesn't support the resolution you have chosen for fullscreen. Choose a different resolution and try again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><u><strong>Graphic corruption when switching resolutions</strong></u> Ensure your graphic drivers are up to date.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><u><strong>Graphic drivers sometimes stop responding when changing resolution</strong></u> This happens with certain older cards and can also cause graphics corruption. Ensure your graphic drivers are up-to-date and try again. If this does not help, try disabling vsync in the control panel of the graphics card or modify the game's configuration.ini file by editing the property <em>useInternalTimer</em> and setting it from false to true.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><u><strong>Crash on start-up</strong></u> If the game is crashing when you launch it, open the cl.log file with a text editor. If you find any obvious errors, try to correct them by redownloading and reinstalling the game, if this does net help use the contact infomation at the bottom of this page to request help, be sure to include cl.log and any relevent infomation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><u><strong>Blurry text and art</strong></u> If your video card has a control panel, there may be settings that allow you to adjust your card to render for &lsquo;quality&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;performance&rsquo; (via a slider). Making this change can solve this blurry text/art problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
